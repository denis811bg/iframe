<p style="width: 70%; margin-left: 150px">
  Social Security Form SSA-1696-U4 is a form that allows you to appoint a third party to represent you when you deal
  with the Social Security Administration (SSA). You can choose to have an attorney as your representative or you can
  appoint any qualified individual you wish. If you like, you can choose to have multiple representatives. Note that you

  permission; provide the SSA with information about and evidence for your claims; accompany you to any meetings or
  interviews with the SSA; request reconsideration of decisions; and assist you and your witnesses with any preparation.

<h2>How to Fill Out Form SSA-1696-U4</h2>
<p style="width: 70%; margin-left: 150px">
  Form SSA-1696-U4 contains three separate parts. The first part is for you to list your information and the name of
  your representative. You’ll need to provide your name and your Social Security Number (SSN), as well as the matters
  for which you’re seeking representation. You also need to provide the name and contact information of your chosen
  representative.

  You’re given four choices for which issues you’re representative will be handling. These are Retirement, Survivors and
  Disability Benefits (covered by Title II of the Social Security Act), Supplemental Security Income (Title XVI),
  Medicare (Title XVIII) and Special Veteran’s Benefits (VII). You’re welcome to check off more than one if that suits
  your situation. You also have the option to appoint multiple representatives. If you choose this route, provide the
  name of the principal representative. Also, make sure to check the box that indicates you’ll have multiple
  representatives.

  Your representative will be responsible for completing the second section of the form. He or she will accept the
  appointment with a signature. Then, he or she will answer a few questions pertaining to their fitness to represent you
  before the SSA. These include if they are an attorney; if they’ve ever been disbarred; and if they’ve ever been
  disqualified from participating in a federal program or appearing before a federal agency. If you are appointing
  multiple representatives, each of them will have to fill out this section individually, so you’ll need multiple copies
  of the form.

  The third section of the form deals with the fee arrangement between you and your representatives. Check the
  appropriate box to indicate how (or if) your representative is being compensated for their assistance. If your
  representative is charging a fee, he or she will need to either file a fee petition with the SSA or submit for
  approval a fee agreement that you’ve both signed. To review all the details about acceptable fee arrangements, you can
  refer to the Information for Representatives section of the form.
